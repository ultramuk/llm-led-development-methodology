# Interview Command

Conducts systematic requirement gathering through persistent, detailed questioning to extract all necessary context.

## Context Clarification

This command IS the context clarification tool. Use it whenever:

1. **Requirements are vague or incomplete**
2. **Multiple interpretations are possible**
3. **Critical details are missing**
4. **Assumptions need validation**

Continue questioning until 100% clarity is achieved.

## Usage

```bash
/interview [topic or requirement]
```

## What It Does

1. **Systematic Questioning** - Asks structured, probing questions to uncover all requirements
2. **Assumption Challenge** - Questions everything that seems obvious and validates assumptions
3. **Context Discovery** - Continues questioning until 100% context clarity is achieved
4. **Gap Identification** - Identifies missing information and edge cases
5. **Complete Picture** - Builds comprehensive requirement understanding through detailed dialogue

## Output

```
Interactive conversation with systematic questions including:
- Technical requirement clarifications
- Edge case identification
- Assumption validation
- Missing context discovery
- Complete requirement specification
```

## Success Criteria

**GOOD** = All requirements fully understood, no ambiguities remain, complete context captured
**BAD** = Vague understanding, assumptions left unchallenged, missing critical information
